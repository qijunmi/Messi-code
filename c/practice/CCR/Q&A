[A]The first parameter of scanf should include format indicator exclusively,not alike with printf,so can`t using scanf("Input:%s",str) as a legal sentence!.

[A]"b * 3" won`t be known the result before compile,it isn`t a compile time constant(because before compile,no sentence will be execute).You can write #define LEN 3,then use len,because macro extend is before compile,LEN will replace by 3.Or you can just declare the array and then using memset to initialize it.

[A]free indeed work for the pointer f if you use free(p),but the what,it means free(prev->next) right,now,prev->next is hanging until you explicit assign a NULL to it.
